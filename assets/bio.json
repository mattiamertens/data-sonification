    "Bio": "The eclectic background Alessio has received has made him an extremely versatile artist. On one hand, he inherits classical and post-romantic piano studies; on the other, he has specialized in the cinematic world, from sound design to mixing. His career is built not just on navigating these two realms, but on their fusion: in both his live and recorded projects, he combines classical and post-romantic repertoire with his own compositions and those of other contemporary composers. His training is aligned with his vision of music: he believes in a strong respect for professionalism and specialization, but without leading to a hermetic sectoriality of art. The ultimate purpose lies in transcending boundaries across diverse artistic realms."
