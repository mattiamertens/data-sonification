                    <p>
                        The record Interplay: Duet for One and for the Other brings together two albums for piano and
                        Disklavier — Diagram and Projection and Spring Scenes — which engaged me as pianist, composer,
                        and producer throughout 2024 and 2025, and which were conceived as an artistic inquiry into the
                        shifting boundaries between human agency and machine autonomy in the contemporary world. This
                        project was realized with the support of Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH. <br> <br>
                        The two suites form a unique project worldwide that places Disklavier technology at the very center
                        of both composition and performance — not as separate stages, but as synchronous and
                        interdependent acts within a single creative process. Indeed, until now the Disklavier has been
                        employed as a medium — for performance, recording, or composition — but never as the core of an
                        aesthetic in which all these phases are integrated and mutually influence one another by virtue of it. <br> <br>
                        I chose to regard the aesthetic framework as the common thread linking both suites, while at the
                        same time expressing it in diﬀerent ways in each project.

                    <p>
                        In Diagram and Projection, the relationship between pianist and Disklavier unfolds through
                        alternating roles during the recording process: I performed my album on a Bösendorfer 280VC
                        Disklavier, extracted the MIDI data of my performance, edited it in Logic Pro, and then re-imported
                        it into the Disklavier, which replayed my edited performance while being captured with microphones
                        for the record. This recording process implements a MIDI pre-production approach, as opposed to
                        the traditional method of audio post-production. Finally, I chose to re-record those more “human”
                        passages that the Disklavier could not fully render.

                        Spring Scenes – a duo performance between the pianist and the Disklavier
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In Spring Scenes, the relationship between pianist and Disklavier develops as a live performance duo:
                        the pianist plays directly on the Disklavier while the instrument simultaneously performs its own
                        part. The pianist interprets musically expressive passages that the Disklavier could not optimally
                        render, while the Disklavier manages rhythmic and mechanical sections beyond the pianist’s physical
                        capabilities. Yet at times, their roles blur, as if they were influencing one another: the pianist imitates
                        the mechanical precision of his partner, while the Disklavier acquires a more human breath. <br><br>

                        It works like a four-hands performance. If not for the fact that the Disklavier has infinite hands. If
                        not for the fact that the pianist is not confined to sitting on one side of the bench and playing mainly
                        on one half of the keyboard. If not for the fact that the pianist can wait for the Disklavier, but the
                        Disklavier cannot wait for the pianist. <br><br>

                        Spring Scenes is connected to Diagram and Projection not only through the shared idea of human–
                        machine interaction and the use of the Disklavier, but also musically. Indeed, the first often presents
                        themes drawn from the second, and even when it introduces new musical ideas, it does so while
                        maintaining the same stylistic gestures as its predecessor.

                    <p>
                        Interplay: Duet for One and for the Other is a project born from the versatility of my artistic identity
                        and from the need to express all of its professional facets within a unified creative vision — from
                        pianist to composer, from sound designer to producer. <br><br>

                        Academic expectations have often pushed me to define myself either as a composer or as a performer
                        — or, at times, as a composer of “absolute” music rather than of film scores, or as a classical pianist
                        opposed to a figure closer to pop. Yet I have always believed it possible to inhabit all these roles
                        within a single art, and that to be everything does not necessarily mean to be less of something.
                        It matters to me to highlight how Interplay: Duet for One and for the Other marked a turning point in
                        my artistic identity, becoming — for me more than for anyone else — the tangible proof of that
                        professional convergence I had long envisioned. A synthesis not born of eclecticism for its own sake,
                        but one that constitutes the very foundation of this music’s existence. <br><br>

                        I have also always found it diﬃcult to write for piano. On one hand, the reason is one shared by many
                        pianist-composers: after studying the masterpieces of the piano repertoire daily for years, one fears
                        not being up to the task when it comes to writing something of one’s own for the same instrument.
                        On the other, the decisive factor was that, once I began composing electronic music, I felt I could
                        fully express my artistic vision, free from the mechanical, timbral, and technical limits of traditional
                        instruments and their performers — since my musical ideas are often more complex than what
                        analog instruments can realize. From here arose the initial impulse to use the Disklavier as a medium
                        of technical extension, in some way bringing the piano closer to the world of electronics. <br><br>

                        This strong bond I have with electronic music and with composition for images also emerges in the
                        compositional language of these pieces, which seem to strive to transcend the mechanics of the
                        keyboard in order to achieve results similar to those I create in audio editing software. In my piano
                        writing, I focus on frequent and detailed changes of dynamics, meter, tempo, and pedalization. This
                        writing represents the sound closest to the transformations I can obtain through channel equalizers,
                        reverb, delay, and similar eﬀects in music production software. For me, this kind of writing is almost more important than the notes themselves; it dismantles every traditional superstructure in the pursuit of preserving an idea born as a free soundscape. Thus I shifted my attention away from the
                        keys and the notes they produce toward the allure of the instrument’s distortion: it is a piano that
                        does not wish to sound like one. <br><br>

                        Often, what interests me most are resonance and reverberation — not as consequences of music, but
                        as its very principle. Instead of composing a passage and passively enduring its natural resonance, I
                        use music to recreate a precise resonance. It is not resonance that exists thanks to my music, but my
                        music that exists for its resonance. Resonance, which normally follows sound, paradoxically comes
                        first. <br><br>

                        A final link with electronics lies in the use of the Disklavier itself, as it has allowed me in practice to
                        merge live performance and production — enabling me to shape my performance through the DAW,
                        and the DAW through my performance. <br><br>

                        An Aesthetic Reflection on Human Crisis Amid Growing AI Symbiosis
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Diagram and Projection is characterized by a hybrid and aesthetically ambiguous identity: the final
                        recording is, in fact, a performance by the Disklavier, which is nothing more than the edited
                        reproduction of my original performance, almost in a relationship of essence and representation. <br><br>

                        Following Kantian philosophy, one could say that the Disklavier performance functions as the
                        phenomenon in relation to the noumenon, which would be my original performance. <br><br>

                        This work also echoes Magritte’s Ceci n’est pas une pipe. Just as Magritte invites the viewer to question
                        the reality of an image — a painting of a pipe that is not a pipe — this project invites the listener to
                        reflect on the very nature of performance: is the reproduction of a performance itself a performance? <br><br>

                        It also follows a Pirandellian perspective on identity: in the end, who is the true performer? Me, the
                        Disklavier, both — or paradoxically, neither? <br><br>

                        The human–machine dualism continues to evolve even after the recording, when I chose to re-record
                        those more “human” passages that the Disklavier could not fully render — an act that demonstrates
                        what the machine still cannot replace: human uniqueness. This reveals a dynamic of mastery, control,
                        and subordination, in which the human uses the machine as an extension of themselves and their
                        abilities. Conversely, the Disklavier executes with technical precision those passages physically
                        demanding for the pianist. They become extensions of one another — a concept that, while marking
                        the culmination of Diagram and Projection, is the starting point for Spring Scenes.
                        In Spring Scenes, sometimes it is the pianist who plays alone, almost rebelling against the relationship
                        with the machine; other times, it is the machine that takes the lead. Sometimes they engage in a
                        harmonious dialogue, sometimes a conflicting one. <br><br>

                        If we consider these two projects as reflections of the rise of technology — and in particular of
                        artificial intelligence — as historical and social phenomena, it is no coincidence that Spring Scenes
                        follows Diagram and Projection. <br><br>

                        In Diagram and Projection, the Disklavier is approached with a utilitarian mindset: it is treated as an
                        instrument. Regardless of the concept of hybrid identity, technology remains a means that the pianist
                        employs to produce a recording. In Spring Scenes, by contrast, the approach is no longer utilitarian
                        but existential: the Disklavier is an equal, a dialogue partner. In the first case, the machine is used; in
                        the second, one coexists with the machine. This reflects the historical evolution of the human–
                        technology relationship: from instrument to a condition of existential symbiosis. <br><br>

                        Above all, Interplay: Duet for One and for the Other looks to the present and the future, oﬀering an
                        aesthetic reflection on the crisis of humanitas in the face of an ever-pervasive symbiosis with artificial
                        intelligence. It is a hybrid project that seeks to unite human and machine in a relationship at times
                        peaceful, at times conflictual — a dynamic that alternately glorifies one or the other, sometimes with
                        critical accents, sometimes as an act of celebration. The music remains suspended on that thin line
                        between the allure of utopia and the fear of real dystopia in contemporary society.
